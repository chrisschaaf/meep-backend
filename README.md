# Meep Backend 2.0

See the old [`README.md`](./README.old.md) for information about how to install and setup this repo using Docker, and for Windows/Linux.

For the time being, the following instructions are for how to set up the Meep Backend end _locally_ with the Meep frontend on Linux/macOS.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 9+
- PostgreSQL extension PostGIS
- Python 3.8+ (we recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing versions)

## Install

### Install `pipenv`

- Install `pipenv` if you don't have it already.

#### Linux

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

#### macOS with Homebrew

```sh
brew install pipenv
```

### Git clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codeforkansascity/meep-backend.git
```

And the `cd` to `./meep-backend` .

### Install Python dependencies

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

### Make sure PostgreSQL/PostGIS is setup

The test database has been switched from sqlite3 to PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension. See [https://postgis.net/install/](https://postgis.net/install/) for how to set up the db for either Linux or macOS. If you aren't familiar with PostgreSQL, it is recommended to use [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).


> Note: To access the db using SQLAlchemy, you may have to change your database authentication with the `pd_hba.conf` file. How this should happen depends on your OS, but in general see [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/auth-pg-hba-conf.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

> Note: Remember to start the PostgreSQL server if you haven't set it up to start at boot.

#### PgAdmin Steps

- When you install PostgreSQL, make sure to install the PostGIS extension
- Create a password for the user `postgres`, e.g. `1234`
- Create a new database called `meep-test` and set the owner to `postgres`
- Connect to `meep-test`
- Run the CREATE EXTENSION command for postgis:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

#### psql CLI Steps

``` sql
pgsql postgres
CREATE USER "postgres" WITH PASSWORD '1234';
CREATE DATABASE "meep-test" WITH OWNER "postgres";
\connect meep-test
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
\q
```

The default config file is `src/instance/env.test.cfg` :

``` python
PG_USER = 'postgres'
PG_PASS = '1234'
PG_HOSTNAME = '127.0.0.1'
PG_DBNAME = 'meep-test'

TESTING = True
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True
DEBUG = True
```

If you chose different configurations than listed in the previous step, update this to match. Otherwise, this can be left as-is.

### Run the test script

For the moment, only a test environment is setup to integrate with the meep frontend.

The script is `scripts/local/run_test_server.sh` and it contains the following

```sh
#!/bin/sh
source $(pipenv --venv)/bin/activate
export APP_SETTINGS=env.test.cfg
export FLASK_APP="api/app:create_app()"
export FLASK_ENV=test
python api/db_operations.py reset test
flask run
```

If first activates the `pipenv` environment, uses `src/instance/env.test.cfg` as the Flask configuration file, resets the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database using `python src/db_operations.py reset test` (if you want to run this manually, do `pipenv src/db_operations.py reset test` ). Finally, it starts the backend API as a Flask app.

#### Make sure the test script is executable

```sh
chmod +x scripts/local/run_test_server.sh
```

#### Run the server

```sh
./scripts/local/run_test_server.sh
```

#### Run Test Server with Randomized Data

You can also run the server with randomly generated data.  
Export the Google Maps API key to your shell environment. This is the same key used in the frontend, ask a maintainer if you do not have it.

```sh
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='<key>'
```

Then run the test server with the `rand` argument and optionally how many projects you want to generate. If you do not provide a number, it will generate the default of 5 projects.

```sh
./scripts/local/run_test_server.sh rand <number>
```

Generating projects can take a few minutes with larger numbers. If you wish to re-use the last set of projects instead of waiting to regenerate more, you can run the script with the `last` argument:

```sh
./scripts/local/run_test_server.sh last
```

### Test the server

If everything went correctly, in the terminal you should see:

and if you open your browser to `127.0.0.1:5000/ping` you should see
